# OATH Dashbord

This repository contains data for an exploratory Flask app to understand data from the [Office of Adminstration Trials and Hearings (OATH)](https://www.nyc.gov/site/oath/index.page). It is pulled from [NYC Open Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/OATH-Hearings-Division-Case-Status/jz4z-kudi/about_data), and for the purposes of exploration, only has a small sample of data.

The app uses dynamic routing to explore individual cases, departments or searches of terms in code violations. 

The OATH Dashboard was created as a final project for Foundations in Computing, Fall 2024 for the Data Journalism program at Columbia Journalism School.
